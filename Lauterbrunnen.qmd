### Day Trip to Lauterbrunnen

After we went paragliding in Interlaken, our pilots asked us what our plans were for the rest of the day. We asked them where we can find a good waterfall and they replied with Lauterbrunnen. So, we took a very quick, last minute trip to Lauterbrunnen to chase some waterfalls. It did not disappoint.
