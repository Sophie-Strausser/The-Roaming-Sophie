### Day One in Paris

Since Interlaken is not too far from Paris, we arrived in Paris with an entire afternoon to spare. At least that would've been the case if we didn't spend an hour in line to get metro tickets. One hour later, we got on the most crowded metro ever! But eventually we made it to our AirBnb where we got ready for our dinner reservations.

We arrived in Paris on June 8th, which also happened to be my 22nd birthday, so we had reservations at a restaurant that overlooked the entire city. We ate a yummy dinner and drank lots of champagne! After dinner, we went out clubbing, woot woot!

### Day Two in Paris

We had an early reservation for the Louvre on day two. The Louvre was stunning. We met the Mona Lisa and Venus de Milo. We probably could have spent the entire day wandering around the museum, but we had other sights to see before the day was over!

We spent the rest of the day exploring the city and seeing all of the major tourist attractions including the Notre Dame which was still under renovation. Right down the street from Notre Dame was Sainte-Chapelle, a breathtaking chapel with the most beautiful stained glass windows and ceilings.

We spent some time at the Eiffel Tower during the day, but the highlight of my time in Paris was seeing the Eiffel Tower sparkle at night. We were also lucky enough to have gone to Paris right after they put the Olympic rings on the Eiffel Tower, which was an exciting sight to see. The photo below was taken on the last night of us all together before I ventured onto Denmark and my friends went home.
