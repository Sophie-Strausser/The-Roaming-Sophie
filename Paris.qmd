### One Day in Paris

Since Interlaken is not too far from Paris, we got to Paris with an entire afternoon to spare. This would've been the case if we didn't spend an hour in line to get metro tickets at the train station. One hour later, we got on the most crowded metro ever! But eventually we made it to our Airbnb where we got ready for our dinner reservations.

We got to Paris on June 8th, which also happened to be my 22nd birthday, so we had reservations at a restaurant that overlooked the entire city. The dinner was delicious and so was the wine and champagne. After dinner, we went out clubbing, which was interesting but fun!

The following morning, we had an early reservation for the Louvre. The Louvre from the outside was almost as beautiful as the art on the inside. We met the Mona Lisa and Venus de Milo. We probably could have spent the entire day in the Louvre, but we had other sights to see before the day was over!

We walked around Paris for the rest of the day and saw all of the attractions including the Notre Dame which was still under renovation. Despite this, the outside was beautiful. Right down the street from Notre Dame was Sainte-Chapelle, a breathtaking chapel with the most beautiful stained glass windows and ceilings.

We spent some time at the Eiffel Tower during the day, however the highlight was seeing it sparkle at night. We were also lucky enough to have gone to Paris right after they put the Olympic rings on the Eiffel Tower. The photo below was taken on the last night of us all together before I ventured onto Denmark and my friends went home.
