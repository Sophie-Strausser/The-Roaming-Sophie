    "text": "One Day in Zaanse Schans\nZaanse Schans was our home base while we were in the Netherlands. We stayed three nights at the most amazing Bed & Breakfast located directly across the water from the famous Zaanse Schans windmills. On our second and final day in Amsterdam, we ventured over the water to see the windmills up close.\n\n\n\n\n\nZaanse Schans was straight out of a fairy tale. As we walked through the colorful town, we were followed by chickens roaming the streets. Goats and sheep laid in the green grass between houses and I had to pinch myself to make sure I wasn’t dreaming.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the outskirts of the town, there is a tall lookout tower with the most amazing view of Zaanse Schans. We took it all in before continuing on to get an up-close view of the windmills.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe picture below is my reaction to the old wooden windmills that lined the water. Some of the windmills had food/drinks inside that you could pay for in order to enter, however we didn’t do this. Instead, we just walked along a paved path until we reached the end and had to turn around.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn our way back to the bridge, we stumbled upon a “free cheese museum” and immediately entered because we all love cheese. After a short history on dutch cheese-making, we walked into a store full of Henry Willig cheese. They had over 20 cheese samples set up around the store as well. We walked into the the Cheese Farm with no idea what to expect and we left with lots of yummy cheese.\n\n\n\nJenna after buying cheese from the Cheese Farm “Catharina Hoeve” by Henri Willig\n\n\nAfter another rainy but successful day, we crossed the bridge back to the neighborhood where our Bed & Breakfast was. We ate some dutch pancakes and called it a day.\n\n\n\nOne of MANY slugs that lined the streets of Zaanse Schans after it rained."

    "text": "Two Days in Prague\nWe arrived in Prague after a very hot train ride with no air conditioning. Once we arrived, we immediately hopped on the metro to get to our Airbnb. The metro was certainly an interesting place for three young girls with big backpacks. We got lots of stares, mostly from men, but we made it to Airbnb safely.\nThe first morning was rainy, so we spent it doing laundry, which was much needed. In the afternoon, we ventured out to Old Town - the most beautiful Old Town Square that I’ve ever seen!\n\n\n\n\n\nThe famous Astronomical Clock is located right in the Old Town Square overlooking a beautiful church. Definitely a sight worth seeing! We spent the rest of the day exploring all of the beautiful streets near Old Town and eating lots of yummy food.\n\n\n\nAstronomical Clock\n\n\n’\nAfter a quick dinner at the pub, we decided to sign up for a ghost tour. The ghost tour took us through lots of history and tales of Prague’s Old Town. Our tour guide, Gordon, was absolutely amazing at telling these stories. The most interesting part of the tour was the Jewish Cemetery, which holds over 100,000 bodies all stacked on top of each other rather than next to each other.\n\n\n\nPrague Old Town at night\n\n\nDay 2 began with a tour of Prague Castle. Prague Castle was absolutely breathtaking. Prague’s history was on full display, in fact, some buildings still had the communist hammer and sickle symbol on them. This made me realize how recently the nation became the Czech Republic.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter the Prague Castle tour, we crossed the Charles Bridge to get to the dock where our boat tour was. The boat tour was very short, but it’s always fun to see the city from the water. We then ended the night at a delicious traditional Czech restaurant and filled our stomach’s before our next travel day."

    "text": "Munich was the first city that we stayed in a Hostel. However, we had a private room at this hostel because a bedroom for three people was a surprisingly similar price to a bedroom for 12 people. The train ride to Munich was long, and when we arrived, it was pouring rain. This wasn’t shocking at all considering it had rained almost every day that we had been in Europe at this point.\nAfter settling into our room, we walked to the Augustiner-Keller beer hall. Unfortunately, the outside was closed due to the rain and the inside had limited capacity. We didn’t have a reservation, and almost had to leave, but they found us three seats at a round communal table with another family. Thank goodness it worked out that way, because the food and beer was delicious!\n\n\n\nAugustiner-Keller\n\n\nWe had one full day in Munich and this day was full of rain. This was unfortunate considering so much of what we wanted to do was outdoors, but we decided to make the most of it! We ate breakfast at a restaurant that overlooked the Marienplatz which is the main plaza in Munich. From there we walked around the Viktualienmarkt for as long as we could without getting completely soaked.\n\n\n\nMarienplatz\n\n\nTo escape the rain, we decided to trek up 306 old wooden stairs to the top of St. Peter’s church that overlooked the city. The view was worth the scary tight stairs.\n\n\n\nSt. Peter’s Church\n\n\nWhen we left St. Peter’s church, it was still raining. So we headed to the famous Hofbrauhaus for some beer. The Hofbrauhaus was overwhelming large with communal tables scattered throughout. There was a live band playing German music which made the search for a table slightly more enjoyable. Eventually, we found a table and ordered some beer and the largest soft pretzel I’ve ever seen!\n\n\n\nHofbrauhaus\n\n\nAfter spending hours inside at the Hofbrauhaus, we met up with an old friend from high school who happened to be in Munich at the same time. We got delicious German dinners (lots of sausage) and called it a night.\nBack at the hostel, we met some fellow Americans. We chatted and played cards until 2 am. We got a few hours of sleep before heading out for yet another long travel day."

We shared this hostel with three other women who refused to open the window… so we spent two very hot nights at this hostel.\nWith only one full day here, we decided to spend it the only way you can when in Interlaken: Paragliding. Unfortunately, paragliding doesn’t take the entire day, so we spent much of the morning wandering around the beautiful town and eating chocolate. Paragliders filled the entire sky all morning as we eagerly waited for our turn.\nEventually, it was our turn to soar through the sky. We drove up a mountain in a van full of people. Next thing I know, I’m running off a mountain.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis was another pinch-me moment. It felt surreal gliding through the air looking at the enormous mountains and bright blue lakes. Definitely a once-in-a-lifetime experience."

    "text": "Two Days in Cinque Terre\nCinque Terre was our second stop in Italy following Rome. We stayed just outside of Cinque Terre in La Spezia for one night before going to our homebase for the next few days, Riomaggiore. From Riomaggiore, we ventured out to the other towns, Manarola, Corniglia, Vernazza, and Monterosso. Although you can hike to all five of the towns, we opted for the short train ride instead.\n\nRiomaggiore\nRiomaggiore is the farthest town south and it was the perfect home base. It was a colorful town, built up on the hill with a beautiful rocky beach.\n\n\n\nRiomaggiore\n\n\nOn our first day, we decided to trek up an absurd amount of stairs in flip flops to a bar with the best view of the town. In the moment, we thought we were going to die of heat stroke, but after getting some ice cream in us at the top, we decided the view was well worth it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nManarola\nManarola felt a bit smaller than Riomaggiore, but it was just as beautiful. We ate a delicious dinner here and caught the sunset over the sea.\n\n\n\nManarola\n\n\n\n\nCorniglia\nWe thought that the hills of Riomaggiore were rough, but little did we know we had to climb what felt like thousands of stairs to even reach the town of Corniglia. Corniglia is built up on a cliff, so the views are gorgeous, but the trek from the train station to the town is deadly.\n\n\n\nCorniglia\n\n\nVernazza\nWe spent the least amount of time in Vernazza. There weren’t very many shops and all of the restaurants we walked into required reservations, which we weren’t aware of. So after wandering for a little bit, we moved on.\n\n\n\nVernazza\n\n\n\n\nMonterosso\nMonterosso is the largest town and the most touristy town. It’s the only town with sandy beaches and hotels. We spent most of our time here laying in the sand and swimming in the crystal clear water. Monterosso was also great for shopping and boy did we shop!\n\n\n\nMonterosso"

    "text": "One Day in Amsterdam\nWith only two days in the Netherlands, we decided to spend one day exploring Amsterdam. The weather app said there was a high chance for “soaking rain” and boy was it right. We began our day with a boat ride through the canals. Luckily, the boat was covered so we were able to stay warm. Our boat ride began at the Heineken Experience and weaved through the beautiful canals of Amsterdam. The tour guide pointed out several sites throughout the tour, but my favorite sites were the unique house boats that lined the canals.\n\nWe had a large gap in our day between the boat tour scheduled in the morning and our reservation at the Van Gogh Museum, so we wandered around the city for hours. After the boat tour, headed toward the floating flower market. The market had lots of flowers, of course, but it also had souvenirs, artwork, and much more!\n\n\n\nFloating Flower Market\n\n\nAfter seeing so many coffee shops advertising stroopwafels, we knew we needed to find a stroopwafel place. We eventually stumbled upon Van Der Wonderen, which is apparently a very famous stroopwafel place, but we didn’t know that when we first walked in. However, after trying the stroopwafels, I can see why this place is famous! I think my life peaked after that first bite of my Oreo stroopwafel.\n\n\n\nVan Der Wonderen Stroopwafels!\n\n\nUnfortunately, we didn’t realize that tickets for the Anne Frank House were released on certain days each week, so we missed out on going inside the museum. However, we did walk over to see the outside of the Anne Frank House, where we saw this decorated bike with the words “Love is the Cure” spray painted on the ground below it. And as you can see in the picture below, the rain was soaking by this point.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe were able to escape the soaking rain and head to the Van Gogh museum for our afternoon reservation. I don’t think that I appreciate art as much as most people, but it was pretty amazing learning about Van Gogh and his art. While Van Gogh’s art was beautiful, I personally enjoyed the exhibition of Matthew Wong’s art even more.\n\n\n\nMatthew Wong Exhibition at the Van Gogh Museum\n\n\nBy the time we left the Van Gogh museum, the sun was finally coming out. We decided to walk through the famous Red Light District on our way back to the train station. We didn’t spend much time in this area, but it was quite an interesting area.\nAfter over 10 miles of walking in soaking rain throughout the entire city of Amsterdam, we decided to call it a day."

We checked into our Airbnb in North Finchley and then wandered the neighborhood with coffee in hand.

By the dock, we caught site of The Eye, but we didn’t actually ride it (we were on a budget). We hopped on the ferry and floated down the Thames River while the tour guide pointed out all of the important sights including Tower Bridge.\n\n\n\nTower Bridge\n\n\nAfter a long day of sight-seeing, we headed back to our Airbnb to prepare for a night at the theater! On our way to the theater, we stopped at Camden Market for dinner. Camden market was certainly a cool area to visit, however the food was average.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter our mediocre dinner, we headed to Piccadilly Theatre to watch Moulin Rouge! The musical was incredible! Definitely worth the late night before our 6 am train ride to Amsterdam!"

This would’ve been the case if we didn’t spend an hour in line to get metro tickets at the train station. One hour later, we got on the most crowded metro ever! But eventually we made it to our Airbnb where we got ready for our dinner reservations.\nWe got to Paris on June 8th, which also happened to be my 22nd birthday, so we had reservations at a restaurant that overlooked the entire city. The dinner was delicious and so was the wine and champagne. After dinner, we went out clubbing, which was interesting but fun!\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following morning, we had an early reservation for the Louvre. The Louvre from the outside was almost as beautiful as the art on the inside. We met the Mona Lisa and Venus de Milo. We probably could have spent the entire day in the Louvre, but we had other sights to see before the day was over!\n\n\n\nThe Louvre\n\n\nWe walked around Paris for the rest of the day and saw all of the attractions including the Notre Dame which was still under renovation. Despite this, the outside was beautiful. Right down the street from Notre Dame was Sainte-Chapelle, a breathtaking chapel with the most beautiful stained glass windows and ceilings.\n\n\n\nSainte-Chapelle\n\n\nWe spent some time at the Eiffel Tower during the day, however the highlight was seeing it sparkle at night.

We then wandered around the area looking for a good restaurant. Every restaurant had was full except for a lovely tourist trap restaurant with pictures of pasta and red sauce on the menu. We were desperate, so we ate that tourist trap pasta and red sauce.\nOur one day in Rome started off rocky. We thought we had a tour of the Colosseum booked for that morning, but we quickly realized that the one day we were in Rome was not a normal day. Several streets were closed off and police cars were everywhere. We didn’t realize what was going on until we got to the office that our tour was supposed to start. The office was closed and we had received an email shortly before the tour that it was cancelled because it was “Italy Day,” which I believe is equivalent to the Fourth of July in the U.S.. On Italy Day, all the tourist attractions, including the Colosseum were free, however, the lines were absurd. We were pretty bummed that we wouldn’t get to go inside the Colosseum and that the tour company waited so long to inform us that there would be no tour. The cherry on top was that it was raining, but we had to make the most of the day.\n\n\n\nRainy Day in Rome\n\n\nWe ditched the Colosseum and headed toward the Trevi Fountain. While there were already lots of people there, we did manage to get a few good pictures. We wished for a sunny day.\n\n\n\nTrevi Fountain\n\n\nWe wandered around the streets of Rome for a while and stopped for lunch with hot chocolate on the side. We attended a pasta-making class in the afternoon and this really lifted our moods. We made three different types of pasta, all with different sauces as well. We learned so much from our amazing teacher, Chef Fabrizio!\n\n\n\n\n\nWith our spirits lifted and the sun out, we headed to our Airbnb for a quick outfit change. Our Airbnb was located in a beautiful alley not too far from the Colosseum.\n\n\n\n\n\nFeeling like brand new people, we headed back to the Colosseum to take pictures while it was sunny out! The Colosseum was stunning from the outside. I hope some day I can go back and see the inside as well.\n\n\n\nThe Colosseum"
