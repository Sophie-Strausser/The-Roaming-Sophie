    "text": "Day Trip to Zaanse Schans\nZaanse Schans was our home base while we were in the Netherlands. We stayed three nights at the most amazing Bed & Breakfast located directly across the water from the famous Zaanse Schans windmills. On our second and final day in the Netherlands, we ventured over the water to see the windmills up close.\n\n\n\n\n\nZaanse Schans was straight out of a fairy tale. As we walked through the colorful town, we were followed by chickens roaming the streets. Goats and sheep laid in the green grass between houses and I had to pinch myself to make sure I wasn’t dreaming.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the outskirts of the town, there is a tall lookout tower with the most amazing view of Zaanse Schans. We took it all in before continuing on to get an up-close view of the windmills.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe picture below is my reaction to the old wooden windmills that lined the water. Some of the windmills had food/drinks inside that you could pay for in order to enter, however we didn’t do this. Instead, we just walked along a paved path until we reached the end and had to turn around.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn our way back to the bridge, we stumbled upon a “free cheese museum” and immediately entered because we all love cheese. After a short history on dutch cheese-making, we walked into a store full of Henry Willig cheese. They had over 20 cheese samples set up around the store as well. We walked into the the Cheese Farm with no idea what to expect and we left with lots of yummy cheese.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter another rainy but successful day, we crossed the bridge back to the neighborhood where our Bed & Breakfast was. We ate some dutch pancakes and called it a day."

We then wandered around the area looking for a good restaurant. Every restaurant was full except for a lovely tourist trap restaurant with pictures of pasta and red sauce on the menu. We were desperate, so we ate the tourist trap pasta and we enjoyed it.\n\n\nDay One in Rome\nOur one day in Rome was off to a rocky start. We thought we had a tour of the Colosseum booked for that morning, but we quickly realized that the one day we were in Rome was not a normal day. Several streets were closed off and police cars were everywhere. We arrived at the tour office, but it was closed. We then realized that we received an email shortly before the tour saying that it was cancelled because it was “Italy Day.” On Italy Day, all the tourist attractions, including the Colosseum were free, however, the lines were way too long. Despite this setback, we had to make the most of the day.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe ditched the Colosseum and headed to the Trevi Fountain. While there were already lots of people there, we did manage to get a few good pictures and wish for a sunny day.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the afternoon, we attended a pasta-making class which completed lifted our spirits. We made three different types of pasta, all with different sauces as well. We learned so much from our amazing teacher, Chef Fabrizio!\n\n\n\n\n\nWith our spirits lifted and the sun shining, we headed to our AirBnb for a quick outfit change. Our AirBnb was located in a beautiful alley not too far from the Colosseum.\n\n\n\n\n\nFeeling like brand new people, we headed back to the Colosseum to take pictures while it was sunny out! The Colosseum was stunning from the outside. I hope some day I can go back and see the inside as well."

But eventually we made it to our AirBnb where we got ready for our dinner reservations.\nWe arrived in Paris on June 8th, which also happened to be my 22nd birthday, so we had reservations at a restaurant that overlooked the entire city. We ate a yummy dinner and drank lots of champagne! After dinner, we went out clubbing, woot woot!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDay Two in Paris\nWe had an early reservation for the Louvre on day two. The Louvre was stunning. We met the Mona Lisa and Venus de Milo. We probably could have spent the entire day wandering around the museum, but we had other sights to see before the day was over!\n\n\n\n\n\nWe spent the rest of the day exploring the city and seeing all of the major tourist attractions including the Notre Dame which was still under renovation. Right down the street from Notre Dame was Sainte-Chapelle, a breathtaking chapel with the most beautiful stained glass windows and ceilings.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe spent some time at the Eiffel Tower during the day, but the highlight of my time in Paris was seeing the Eiffel Tower sparkle at night. We were also lucky enough to have gone to Paris right after they put the Olympic rings on the Eiffel Tower, which was an exciting sight to see. The photo below was taken on the last night of us all together before I ventured onto Denmark and my friends went home."

We checked into our Airbnb in North Finchley and wandered around the neighborhood with a coffee in hand.

We hopped on the tube and headed toward Buckingham Palace. Buckingham Palace was as beautiful as I imagined it would be. We walked around the area and made sure to stop and say hi to the horse guards.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter seeing Buckingham Palace we walked toward the other must-see sights of London, including Big Ben!\n\n\n\n\n\nWe had a ferry tour scheduled in the early afternoon, so we made our way toward the Thames river to catch our ferry! By the dock, we caught site of The Eye, but we didn’t actually ride it (we were on a budget). We hopped on the ferry and floated down the Thames River while the tour guide pointed out all of the important sights including Tower Bridge.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter a long day of sight-seeing, we headed back to our AirBnb to prepare for a night at the theater! On our way to the theater, we stopped at Camden Market for dinner. Camden market was certainly a cool area to visit, however the food was mediocre.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter Camden Market, we headed to Piccadilly Theatre to watch Moulin Rouge! The musical was incredible! Definitely worth the late night before our 6 am train ride to Amsterdam!"

There, I saw the changing of the guards and I was shocked at how young the guards were!\n\n\n\n\n\nMy day ended with a climb up the Round Tower for a panoramic view of Copenhagen. The climb was quite fun because there were no stairs involved, just a walkway that slowly spiraled up the tower.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the end of the day, I decided to walk back through the natural area to try to see the highland cows. This seemed like a good idea in the moment, but then the clouds rolled in, which was followed by wind and rain. After taking shelter for a bit, I walked back through the natural area searching for cows. Although I could hear them, I never saw them.\nSo eventually, I gave up on my dream of seeing the highland cows and headed back to my AirBnb for a good night sleep before traveling to my next stop!"

After checking into the hotel, I spent the remainder of my first day exploring Aarhus and the football scene. There was a big football game that was broadcasted live on a big screen by the harbor. It was quite intense, but I couldn’t see a thing over the crowd! I eventually decided to ditch the game, grab some ice cream, and head home.\n\n\nDay Two in Aarhus\nMy full day in Aarhus began at the ARoS Art Museum. This was my favorite museum of the entire trip. The top of the museum had a panoramic rainbow view of the city. The museum had a bunch of different exhibits that showcased a variety of amazing artists. One of the most famous pieces of art was called “The Boy” which was a huge sculpture of a boy. The pictures don’t do it justice, it was incredibly large and very realistic.\n\nI spent the rest of the day wandering the streets of Aarhus. I visited a small underground viking museum, the Latin Quarter, and the Aarhus Cathedral. The cathedral was very simple compared to most of the churches I’d visited earlier on in the trip.\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring my solo adventure I became quite comfortable sipping on warm drinks at coffee shops and reading my book.

The weather app said there was a high chance for “soaking rain” and boy was it right. We began our day with a boat ride through the canals. Luckily, the boat was covered so we were able to stay warm. Our boat ride began at the Heineken Experience and weaved through the beautiful canals of Amsterdam. The tour guide pointed out several sights throughout the tour, but my favorite sights were the unique house boats that lined the canals.\n\nWe had a large gap in our day between the boat tour scheduled in the morning and our reservation at the Van Gogh Museum, so we wandered around the city for hours. After the boat tour, we headed toward the floating flower market. The market had lots of flowers, of course, but it also had souvenirs, artwork, and much more!\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter seeing so many coffee shops advertising stroopwafels, we knew we needed to find a stroopwafel place. We eventually stumbled upon Van Der Wonderen, which is apparently a very famous stroopwafel place, but we didn’t know that when we first walked in. However, after trying the stroopwafels, I can see why this place is famous! I think my life peaked after that first bite of my Oreo stroopwafel.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, we didn’t realize that tickets for the Anne Frank House were released on certain days each week, so we missed out on going inside the museum. However, we did walk over to see the outside of the Anne Frank House, where we saw this decorated bike with the words “Love is the Cure” spray painted on the ground below it. And as you can see in the picture below, the rain was soaking by this point.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe were able to escape the soaking rain and head to the Van Gogh museum for our afternoon reservation. I don’t think that I appreciate art as much as most people, but it was pretty amazing learning about Van Gogh and his art. While Van Gogh’s art was beautiful, I personally enjoyed the exhibition of Matthew Wong’s art even more.\n\n\n\n\n\nBy the time we left the Van Gogh museum, the sun was finally coming out. We decided to walk through the famous Red Light District on our way back to the train station. We didn’t spend much time in this area, but it was quite interesting.\nAfter over 10 miles of walking in soaking rain throughout the entire city of Amsterdam, we decided to call it a day."

It was a colorful town, built up on the hill with a beautiful rocky beach.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn our first day, we decided to trek up an insane amount of stairs in flip flops to reach a bar with the best view of the town.

We ate a delicious dinner here and caught the sunset over the sea.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorniglia\nWe thought that the hills of Riomaggiore were rough, but little did we know we had to climb hundreds of stairs just to reach the town of Corniglia. Corniglia is built up on a cliff, so the views are gorgeous, but the trek from the train station to the town is deadly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVernazza\nWe spent the least amount of time in Vernazza. There weren’t very many shops and all of the restaurants we walked into required reservations. So after wandering for a little bit, we moved on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMonterosso\nMonterosso is the largest town and most touristy town in Cinque Terre. It’s also the only town with sandy beaches. We spent most of our time here laying in the sand and swimming in the crystal clear water. Monterosso was also great for shopping and boy did we shop!"

The view was worth the scary tight stairs.\n\nWhen we left St. Peter’s church, it was still raining. So we headed to the famous Hofbrauhaus for some beer.

    "text": "WWOOFing in Nordby!\nWhen I planned my trip to Europe, I decided to branch of solo from my friends to work on a farm and learn about organic agricultural practices in other countries. Through WWOOF, I found a lovely farm in Nordby. Nordby is a very small town on the very small island of Samso, Denmark.\nSamso Bryghus is a farm, cafe and brewery where I spent a week learning about organic agricultural practices. When I first arrived in Nordby, I was the only WWOOFer there, so I got first dibs on my bedroom. I picked the prettiest bedroom with the least amount of spiders.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy first official day working on the farm was straight out of a movie. A comedy movie. I was told to meet the owner outside with a bike at 9:30 am. So that morning, I went to the shed to grab a bike and all of the bikes were covered in spider webs. I quickly grabbed a bike that was too big for me, but I did not want to touch the spiderwebs. Stinne, the owner, pulled up on an ATV and told me to follow her on my bike. I hopped on my bike and tried my best to keep up with her through the hilly streets of town and fields. We finally got to a dirt road and the owner looked at me and asked if I’d never ridden a bike before. I laughed and said not often. She then told me to hop on her ATV because I was going to slow, so I did.\nWe visited the goats, the lettuce fields and the potato fields. We stopped to harvest some potatoes and Stinne, told me to go harvest some potatoes for my dinner. I had never harvested potatoes before, so I asked Stinne to clarify how to harvest them. She laughed and gave me a quick lesson on harvesting potatoes and then pointed me to a corner of the field where I could harvest them. After trying my best to harvest the potatoes, I ended up with about 5 potatoes. She laughed at this as well, but we moved on.\nShe brought me back to my bike and had me follow her to the strawberry fields. The strawberry fields are where I ended up spending most of my time on the farm. I was there almost every morning harvesting strawberries before heading to the cafe to help prep for lunch. The strawberry fields were my happy place.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile I was enjoying my time working on the farm and in the cafe, I found that I was very lonely when I went back home for the evenings. So, I tried to stay busy by exploring different parts of the island. My first adventure was to Ballebjerg, which is west of Nordby. I biked for as long as I could, but the hill got very steep and I ended up walking my bike up most of the way. The view was worth it.\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout half way through my stay on the farm, a group of 6 french people joined me as WWOOFers. They were very kind, but they all knew each other and all spoke french, obviously. I thought that I felt lonely by myself, however, this felt like a different type of lonely. Despite this, we all enjoyed dinner together, watched movies at night, and worked together very well.\nEven with other WWOOFers in the house, I still tried to stay busy when I wasn’t working. One day, I decided to find the beach, so I walked east. I walked this time because biking was clearly not my specialty. I walked through the town of Nordby and some fields with sheep. I eventually found the sea and dipped my toes in the cold water. Even though it was June, it was still quite cold outside, so the water was very chilly!\n\n\n\n\n\nOn my last day at the farm, I didn’t have to work. Instead, I took the day to explore the island. So, I woke up early and biked up to the northern most part of the island, Issehoved. Issehoved was absolutely stunning. I walked through a pasture of sheep to reach the beach where small waves from the Baltic Sea crashed onto the shore. It was windy and cold, but I stayed for as long as I could to take it all in.\n\n\n\n\n\nI left the farm filled with so much gratitude. While difficult and isolating at times, I wouldn’t trade the experience for anything. Working at Samso Bryghus taught me so much. I learned how to harvest all sorts of fruits and vegetables. I ate some of the most delicious food. When I asked Stinne why the potatoes were so good, she simply replied with “because they are fresh.” I also learned so much about myself. I’m a very independent person, but my time on this farm really put my independence to the test. I was very lonely at times, but in those moments, I had to remind myself of the amazing work I was doing in a beautiful country. It was an amazing experience!"

We got lots of stares, mostly from men, but we made it to AirBnb safely.\n\n\nDay One in Prague\nThe first morning was rainy, so we spent it doing laundry, which was much needed. In the afternoon, we ventured out to Old Town - the most beautiful Old Town Square that I’ve ever seen!\n\n\n\n\n\nThe famous Astronomical Clock is located right in the Old Town Square overlooking a beautiful church. Definitely a sight worth seeing! We spent the rest of the day exploring all of the beautiful streets near Old Town and eating lots of yummy food.\n\n\n\n\n\n’\nAfter a quick dinner at the pub, we decided to sign up for a ghost tour. The ghost tour took us through lots of history and tales of Prague’s Old Town. Our tour guide, Gordon, was absolutely amazing at telling these stories. The most interesting part of the tour was the Jewish Cemetery, which holds over 100,000 bodies all stacked on top of each other rather than next to each other.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDay Two in Prague\nDay 2 began with a tour of Prague Castle. Prague Castle was absolutely breathtaking. Prague’s history was on full display, in fact, some buildings still had the communist hammer and sickle symbol on them. This made me realize how recently the nation became the Czech Republic.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter the Prague Castle tour, we crossed the Charles Bridge to get to the dock where our boat tour was. The boat tour was very short, but it’s always fun to see the city from the water.

My first major stop in Stockholm was of course the ABBA museum! I had a blast listening to lots of ABBA songs and learning all about them. I think it would’ve been more fun with a friend because there were so many interactive activities that guests can do. For example, you can dance with holograms of ABBA or record a song in the recording studio, but I never worked up the courage to do this by myself. Overall, it was a fantastic ABBA experience.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter going to the ABBA museum, I decided to find a place for lunch. I stumbled upon a beautiful cafe along the water where I grabbed some food. During this lunch, I learned about Fika. Fika is a Swedish tradition where you take some time to pause and enjoy a hot drink and a sweet treat. I took this tradition very seriously after learning about it and decided to order a piece of cake and a matcha after finishing my lunch.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy next stop was the Vasa Museum. This museum showcases an old ship that sunk in the harbor in the 1600s and was recovered in nearly pristine condition due to the brackish waters up north. I was in awe of how large and detailed the ship was.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter a full day of visiting museums, I decided to take a tour of what felt like an art museum, but it was just the metro stations. Stockholm’s metro stations are all very unique and beautiful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDay Two in Stockholm\nI woke up early on the second day to visit Stockholm’s old town before it got too crowded. Old town was on a different island than the one I was staying on, so after a bit of a walk, I ended up immersed in the beautiful, colorful buildings. I spent the morning taking pictures and then decided to practice Fika once again, this time with a cinnamon roll and a hot chocolate in hand.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter some shopping in old town, I decided to take an impromptu kayak ride in the harbor. I kayaked around the harbor for an hour taking in the views from the water.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn my last night in Europe, I treated myself to a fancy dinner. I had Swedish meatballs with mashed potatoes. The meal was life changing.\n\n\n\n\n\nI woke up early to begin my journey back to the U.S.. While I certainly was going to miss Europe, I was excited to get home and see my family again. I’m incredibly grateful that I had the opportunity to go on this adventure and I’m hoping for many more adventures in the future!"
