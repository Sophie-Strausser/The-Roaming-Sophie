### Day Trip to Amsterdam

With only two days in the Netherlands, we decided to spend one day exploring Amsterdam. The weather app said there was a high chance for "soaking rain" and boy was it right. We began our day with a boat ride through the canals. Luckily, the boat was covered so we were able to stay warm. Our boat ride began at the Heineken Experience and weaved through the beautiful canals of Amsterdam. The tour guide pointed out several sights throughout the tour, but my favorite sights were the unique house boats that lined the canals.\

We had a large gap in our day between the boat tour scheduled in the morning and our reservation at the Van Gogh Museum, so we wandered around the city for hours. After the boat tour, we headed toward the floating flower market. The market had lots of flowers, of course, but it also had souvenirs, artwork, and much more!

After seeing so many coffee shops advertising stroopwafels, we knew we needed to find a stroopwafel place. We eventually stumbled upon Van Der Wonderen, which is apparently a very famous stroopwafel place, but we didn't know that when we first walked in. However, after trying the stroopwafels, I can see why this place is famous! I think my life peaked after that first bite of my Oreo stroopwafel.

Unfortunately, we didn't realize that tickets for the Anne Frank House were released on certain days each week, so we missed out on going inside the museum. However, we did walk over to see the outside of the Anne Frank House, where we saw this decorated bike with the words "Love is the Cure" spray painted on the ground below it. And as you can see in the picture below, the rain was soaking by this point.

We were able to escape the soaking rain and head to the Van Gogh museum for our afternoon reservation. I don't think that I appreciate art as much as most people, but it was pretty amazing learning about Van Gogh and his art. While Van Gogh's art was beautiful, I personally enjoyed the exhibition of Matthew Wong's art even more.

By the time we left the Van Gogh museum, the sun was finally coming out. We decided to walk through the famous Red Light District on our way back to the train station. We didn't spend much time in this area, but it was quite interesting.

After over 10 miles of walking in soaking rain throughout the entire city of Amsterdam, we decided to call it a day.
