### Our Day in Interlaken

Interlaken felt like a dream. We arrived in the afternoon and settled into our hostel, which had the most gorgeous view right outside the window.

With only one full day here, we decided to spend it the only way you can when in Interlaken: Paragliding. Unfortunately, paragliding doesn't take the entire day, so we spent much of the morning wandering around the town and getting chocolate wasted (meaning we ate a lot of chocolate).

Eventually, it was our turn to soar through the sky. We drove up a mountain in a van full of people and the next thing I know, I'm running off a mountain.

This was another pinch-me moment. It felt surreal gliding through the air looking at the enormous mountains and bright blue lakes. Definitely a once-in-a-lifetime experience.
