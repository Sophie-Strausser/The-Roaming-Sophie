### Interlaken

Interlaken was absolutely stunning! We arrived in the afternoon and settled into our hostel that had the most gorgeous view right outside the window. We shared this hostel with three other women who refused to open the window... so we spent two very hot nights at this hostel.

With only one full day here, we decided to spend it the only way you can when in Interlaken: Paragliding. Unfortunately, paragliding doesn't take the entire day, so we spent much of the morning wandering around the beautiful town and eating chocolate. Paragliders filled the entire sky all morning as we eagerly waited for our turn.

Eventually, it was our turn to soar through the sky. We drove up a mountain in a van full of people. Next thing I know, I'm running off a mountain.

This was another pinch-me moment. It felt surreal gliding through the air looking at the enormous mountains and bright blue lakes. Definitely a once-in-a-lifetime experience.
