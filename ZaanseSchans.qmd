### Day Trip to Zaanse Schans

Zaanse Schans was our home base while we were in the Netherlands. We stayed three nights at the most amazing Bed & Breakfast located directly across the water from the famous Zaanse Schans windmills. On our second and final day in the Netherlands, we ventured over the water to see the windmills up close.

Zaanse Schans was straight out of a fairy tale. As we walked through the colorful town, we were followed by chickens roaming the streets. Goats and sheep laid in the green grass between houses and I had to pinch myself to make sure I wasn't dreaming.

On the outskirts of the town, there is a tall lookout tower with the most amazing view of Zaanse Schans. We took it all in before continuing on to get an up-close view of the windmills.

The picture below is my reaction to the old wooden windmills that lined the water. Some of the windmills had food/drinks inside that you could pay for in order to enter, however we didn't do this. Instead, we just walked along a paved path until we reached the end and had to turn around.

On our way back to the bridge, we stumbled upon a "free cheese museum" and immediately entered because we all love cheese. After a short history on dutch cheese-making, we walked into a store full of Henry Willig cheese. They had over 20 cheese samples set up around the store as well. We walked into the the Cheese Farm with no idea what to expect and we left with lots of yummy cheese.

After another rainy but successful day, we crossed the bridge back to the neighborhood where our Bed & Breakfast was. We ate some dutch pancakes and called it a day.
