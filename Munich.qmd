title: "Munich"

Munich was the first city that we stayed in a Hostel. However, we had a private room at this hostel because a bedroom for three people was a surprisingly similar price to a bedroom for 12 people. The train ride to Munich was long, and when we arrived, it was pouring rain. This wasn't shocking at all considering it had rained almost every day that we had been in Europe at this point.

After settling into our room, we walked to the Augustiner-Keller beer hall. Unfortunately, the outside was closed due to the rain and the inside had limited capacity. We didn't have a reservation, and almost had to leave, but they found us three seats at a round communal table with another family. Thank goodness it worked out that way, because the food and beer was delicious!

We had one full day in Munich and this day was full of rain. This was unfortunate considering so much of what we wanted to do was outdoors, but we decided to make the most of it! We ate breakfast at a restaurant that overlooked the Marienplatz which is the main plaza in Munich. From there we walked around the Viktualienmarkt for as long as we could without getting completely soaked.

To escape the rain, we decided to trek up 306 old wooden stairs to the top of St. Peter's church that overlooked the city. The view was worth the scary tight stairs.

When we left St. Peter's church, it was still raining. So we headed to the famous Hofbrauhaus for some beer. The Hofbrauhaus was overwhelming large with communal tables scattered throughout. There was a live band playing German music which made the search for a table slightly more enjoyable. Eventually, we found a table and ordered some beer and the largest soft pretzel I've ever seen!

After spending hours inside at the Hofbrauhaus, we met up with an old friend from high school who happened to be in Munich at the same time. We got delicious German dinners (lots of sausage) and called it a night.

Back at the hostel, we met some fellow Americans. We chatted and played cards until 2 am. We got a few hours of sleep before heading out for yet another long travel day.
