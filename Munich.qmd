### Day One in Munich

When we arrived in Munich, it was pouring rain. This wasn't shocking at all considering it had rained almost every day that we had been in Europe at this point.

After settling into our hostel, we walked to the Augustiner-Keller beer hall. Unfortunately, the outside was closed due to the rain and the inside had limited capacity. We didn't have a reservation, but as we were leaving they found us three seats at a round communal table with another family. The food and beer was delicious!

### Day Two in Munich

We had one full day in Munich and this day was full of rain. This was unfortunate considering so much of what we wanted to do was outdoors, but we made the most of it! We ate breakfast at a restaurant that overlooked the Marienplatz which is the main plaza in Munich. From there we walked around the Viktualienmarkt for as long as we could without getting completely soaked.

To escape the rain, we trekked up 306 old wooden stairs to the top of St. Peter's church that overlooked the city. The view was worth the scary tight stairs.

When we left St. Peter's church, it was still raining. So we headed to the famous Hofbrauhaus for some beer. The Hofbrauhaus was overwhelmingingly large with communal tables scattered throughout. There was a live band playing German music which made the search for a table slightly more enjoyable. Once we found a table, we ordered some beer and the largest soft pretzel I've ever seen!

After spending hours inside at the Hofbrauhaus, we met up with an old friend from high school who happened to be in Munich at the same time. We got a delicious German dinner (lots of sausage) and called it a night.

Back at the hostel, we met some fellow Americans who we ended up chatting with until 2 am. Luckily, we got a few hours of sleep before heading out for yet another long travel day.
