Hi there! My name is Sophie. In May of 2024, I set out on a big adventure through 14 different cities/towns across 9 different countries in Europe. I spent three weeks with two of my closest friends (pictured below) squeezing in as many destinations as we could into such a short time. I then branched off on my own for a solo trip to Denmark and Sweden. This website details our amazing journey through Europe!
