Copenhagen was my first solo destination of the trip. I arrived early in the morning and immediately knew I was in Denmark when I saw an amazon biker. Not a driver, a biker. I stayed in a private room inside a very cute house about an hour walk from the main city.

### Day One in Copenhagen

During my one full day in Copenhagen, I decided to walk into the city through a natural area that apparently had highland cows (I didn't see any). I walked along the water up to the city and stopped for brunch at a cute restaurant. Once I arrived in the city, my first stop was Nyhavn to see the famous colorful buildings of Copenhagen.

From here, I wandered over to The King's Garden where I took a break to eat a delicious danish cinnamon roll.

After seeing the King's Garden, I visited the Rosenborg Castle and the Christiansborg Palace, which is the current Danish Parliament building. There, I saw the changing of the guards and I was shocked at how young the guards were!

My day ended with a climb up the Round Tower for a panoramic view of Copenhagen. The climb was quite fun because there were no stairs involved, just a walkway that slowly spiraled up the tower.

At the end of the day, I decided to walk back through the natural area to try to see the highland cows. This seemed like a good idea in the moment, but then the clouds rolled in, which was followed by wind and rain. After taking shelter for a bit, I walked back through the natural area searching for cows. Although I could hear them, I never saw them.

So eventually, I gave up on my dream of seeing the highland cows and headed back to my AirBnb for a good night sleep before traveling to my next stop!
