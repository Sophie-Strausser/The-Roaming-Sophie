### WWOOFing in Nordby!

When I planned my trip to Europe, I decided to branch of solo from my friends to work on a farm and learn about organic agricultural practices in other countries. Through WWOOF, I found a lovely farm in Nordby. Nordby is a very small town on the very small island of Samso, Denmark.

Samso Bryghus is a farm, cafe and brewery where I spent a week learning about organic agricultural practices. When I first arrived in Nordby, I was the only WWOOFer there, so I got first dibs on my bedroom. I picked the prettiest bedroom with the least amount of spiders.

My first official day working on the farm was straight out of a movie. A comedy movie. I was told to meet the owner outside with a bike at 9:30 am. So that morning, I went to the shed to grab a bike and all of the bikes were covered in spider webs. I quickly grabbed a bike that was too big for me, but I did not want to touch the spiderwebs. Stinne, the owner, pulled up on an ATV and told me to follow her on my bike. I hopped on my bike and tried my best to keep up with her through the hilly streets of town and fields. We finally got to a dirt road and the owner looked at me and asked if I'd never ridden a bike before. I laughed and said not often. She then told me to hop on her ATV because I was going to slow, so I did.

We visited the goats, the lettuce fields and the potato fields. We stopped to harvest some potatoes and Stinne, told me to go harvest some potatoes for my dinner. I had never harvested potatoes before, so I asked Stinne to clarify how to harvest them. She laughed and gave me a quick lesson on harvesting potatoes and then pointed me to a corner of the field where I could harvest them. After trying my best to harvest the potatoes, I ended up with about 5 potatoes. She laughed at this as well, but we moved on.

She brought me back to my bike and had me follow her to the strawberry fields. The strawberry fields are where I ended up spending most of my time on the farm. I was there almost every morning harvesting strawberries before heading to the cafe to help prep for lunch. The strawberry fields were my happy place.

While I was enjoying my time working on the farm and in the cafe, I found that I was very lonely when I went back home for the evenings. So, I tried to stay busy by exploring different parts of the island. My first adventure was to Ballebjerg, which is west of Nordby. I biked for as long as I could, but the hill got very steep and I ended up walking my bike up most of the way. The view was worth it.

About half way through my stay on the farm, a group of 6 french people joined me as WWOOFers. They were very kind, but they all knew each other and all spoke french, obviously. I thought that I felt lonely by myself, however, this felt like a different type of lonely. Despite this, we all enjoyed dinner together, watched movies at night, and worked together very well.

Even with other WWOOFers in the house, I still tried to stay busy when I wasn't working. One day, I decided to find the beach, so I walked east. I walked this time because biking was clearly not my specialty. I walked through the town of Nordby and some fields with sheep. I eventually found the sea and dipped my toes in the cold water. Even though it was June, it was still quite cold outside, so the water was very chilly!

On my last day at the farm, I didn't have to work. Instead, I took the day to explore the island. So, I woke up early and biked up to the northern most part of the island, Issehoved. Issehoved was absolutely stunning. I walked through a pasture of sheep to reach the beach where small waves from the Baltic Sea crashed onto the shore. It was windy and cold, but I stayed for as long as I could to take it all in.

I left the farm filled with so much gratitude. While difficult and isolating at times, I wouldn't trade the experience for anything. Working at Samso Bryghus taught me so much. I learned how to harvest all sorts of fruits and vegetables. I ate some of the most delicious food. When I asked Stinne why the potatoes were so good, she simply replied with "because they are fresh." I also learned so much about myself. I'm a very independent person, but my time on this farm really put my independence to the test. I was very lonely at times, but in those moments, I had to remind myself of the amazing work I was doing in a beautiful country. It was an amazing experience!
