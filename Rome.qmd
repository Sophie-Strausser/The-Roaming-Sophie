### Arrive in Rome

Our travel day from Munich to Rome was incredibly long. We arrived in Rome pretty late and headed straight to our AirBnb. We then wandered around the area looking for a good restaurant. Every restaurant was full except for a lovely tourist trap restaurant with pictures of pasta and red sauce on the menu. We were desperate, so we ate the tourist trap pasta and we enjoyed it.

### Day One in Rome

Our one day in Rome was off to a rocky start. We thought we had a tour of the Colosseum booked for that morning, but we quickly realized that the one day we were in Rome was not a normal day. Several streets were closed off and police cars were everywhere. We arrived at the tour office, but it was closed. We then realized that we received an email shortly before the tour saying that it was cancelled because it was "Italy Day." On Italy Day, all the tourist attractions, including the Colosseum were free, however, the lines were way too long. Despite this setback, we had to make the most of the day.

We ditched the Colosseum and headed to the Trevi Fountain. While there were already lots of people there, we did manage to get a few good pictures and wish for a sunny day.

In the afternoon, we attended a pasta-making class which completed lifted our spirits. We made three different types of pasta, all with different sauces as well. We learned so much from our amazing teacher, Chef Fabrizio!

With our spirits lifted and the sun shining, we headed to our AirBnb for a quick outfit change. Our AirBnb was located in a beautiful alley not too far from the Colosseum.

Feeling like brand new people, we headed back to the Colosseum to take pictures while it was sunny out! The Colosseum was stunning from the outside. I hope some day I can go back and see the inside as well.
