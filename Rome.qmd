### One Day in Rome

Our travel day from Munich to Rome was incredibly long. We arrived in Rome pretty late and headed straight to our Airbnb. We then wandered around the area looking for a good restaurant. Every restaurant had was full except for a lovely tourist trap restaurant with pictures of pasta and red sauce on the menu. We were desperate, so we ate that tourist trap pasta and red sauce.

Our one day in Rome started off rocky. We thought we had a tour of the Colosseum booked for that morning, but we quickly realized that the one day we were in Rome was not a normal day. Several streets were closed off and police cars were everywhere. We didn't realize what was going on until we got to the office that our tour was supposed to start. The office was closed and we had received an email shortly before the tour that it was cancelled because it was "Italy Day," which I believe is equivalent to the Fourth of July in the U.S.. On Italy Day, all the tourist attractions, including the Colosseum were free, however, the lines were absurd. We were pretty bummed that we wouldn't get to go inside the Colosseum and that the tour company waited so long to inform us that there would be no tour. The cherry on top was that it was raining, but we had to make the most of the day.

We ditched the Colosseum and headed toward the Trevi Fountain. While there were already lots of people there, we did manage to get a few good pictures. We wished for a sunny day.

We wandered around the streets of Rome for a while and stopped for lunch with hot chocolate on the side. We attended a pasta-making class in the afternoon and this really lifted our moods. We made three different types of pasta, all with different sauces as well. We learned so much from our amazing teacher, Chef Fabrizio!

With our spirits lifted and the sun out, we headed to our Airbnb for a quick outfit change. Our Airbnb was located in a beautiful alley not too far from the Colosseum.

Feeling like brand new people, we headed back to the Colosseum to take pictures while it was sunny out! The Colosseum was stunning from the outside. I hope some day I can go back and see the inside as well.
