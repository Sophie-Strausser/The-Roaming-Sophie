### Day One in Aarhus

I arrived in Aarhus early in the morning on a ferry from Samso. While waiting to check into my hotel I stopped at a bakery to get a famous danish cinnamon roll. It was the most amazing cinnamon roll I'd ever tasted. I sat in the bakery reading my book and sipping on matcha for most of the morning. After checking into the hotel, I spent the remainder of my first day exploring Aarhus and the football scene. There was a big football game that was broadcasted live on a big screen by the harbor. It was quite intense, but I couldn't see a thing over the crowd! I eventually decided to ditch the game, grab some ice cream, and head home.

### Day Two in Aarhus

My full day in Aarhus began at the ARoS Art Museum. This was my favorite museum of the entire trip. The top of the museum had a panoramic rainbow view of the city. The museum had a bunch of different exhibits that showcased a variety of amazing artists. One of the most famous pieces of art was called "The Boy" which was a huge sculpture of a boy. The pictures don't do it justice, it was incredibly large and very realistic.

I spent the rest of the day wandering the streets of Aarhus. I visited a small underground viking museum, the Latin Quarter, and the Aarhus Cathedral. The cathedral was very simple compared to most of the churches I'd visited earlier on in the trip.

During my solo adventure I became quite comfortable sipping on warm drinks at coffee shops and reading my book. So, that is exactly what I did for the remainder of the evening. And the next morning, I began my journey to my last stop of the trip, Stockholm.
