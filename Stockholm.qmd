### Day One in Stockholm

I completely fell in love with Stockholm during my short time there. The city is made up of a bunch of beautiful islands and the weather was perfect. My first major stop in Stockholm was of course the ABBA museum! I had a blast listening to lots of ABBA songs and learning all about them. I think it would've been more fun with a friend because there were so many interactive activities that guests can do. For example, you can dance with holograms of ABBA or record a song in the recording studio, but I never worked up the courage to do this by myself. Overall, it was a fantastic ABBA experience.

After going to the ABBA museum, I decided to find a place for lunch. I stumbled upon a beautiful cafe along the water where I grabbed some food. During this lunch, I learned about Fika. Fika is a Swedish tradition where you take some time to pause and enjoy a hot drink and a sweet treat. I took this tradition very seriously after learning about it and decided to order a piece of cake and a matcha after finishing my lunch.

My next stop was the Vasa Museum. This museum showcases an old ship that sunk in the harbor in the 1600s and was recovered in nearly pristine condition due to the brackish waters up north. I was in awe of how large and detailed the ship was.

After a full day of visiting museums, I decided to take a tour of what felt like an art museum, but it was just the metro stations. Stockholm's metro stations are all very unique and beautiful.

### Day Two in Stockholm

I woke up early on the second day to visit Stockholm's old town before it got too crowded. Old town was on a different island than the one I was staying on, so after a bit of a walk, I ended up immersed in the beautiful, colorful buildings. I spent the morning taking pictures and then decided to practice Fika once again, this time with a cinnamon roll and a hot chocolate in hand.

After some shopping in old town, I decided to take an impromptu kayak ride in the harbor. I kayaked around the harbor for an hour taking in the views from the water.

On my last night in Europe, I treated myself to a fancy dinner. I had Swedish meatballs with mashed potatoes. The meal was life changing.

I woke up early to begin my journey back to the U.S.. While I certainly was going to miss Europe, I was excited to get home and see my family again. I'm incredibly grateful that I had the opportunity to go on this adventure and I'm hoping for many more adventures in the future!
